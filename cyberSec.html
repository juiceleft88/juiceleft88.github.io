    The majority of the Cyber Security projects I have worked on have used Linux virtual machines to simulate attacks and preventative measures. 
    A few have also been a collaborative effort between myself and a colleague. Below are the written reports of my methods. 
    Click <a href="https://github.com/juiceleft88/CyberSecurity"> <strong><u>here</u></strong> </a> to see more projects.

        <h2><strong> Secret Key Encryption </strong></h2>
        <br>
        In this project, the first task is to employ a frequency analysis of letters in the alphabet to break a monoalphabetic cypher, and find the related encryption key.
        I then used the encryption key to decipher the entire plaintext message. I also encrypted an image file, and decrypted another to understand how these concepts work with
        files in the directory.

        <h2><strong> Encryption and Decryption using RSA </strong></h2>
        <br>
        The goal of this project is to get hands-on experience using RSA algorithms in a virtual linux environment. I implemented the mathematical algorithms in detailed steps on
        actual large numbers in order to generate public and private keys and perform encryption and decryption, as well as generate and verify signatures.

        <h2><strong> SQL Injection </strong></h2>
        <br>
        The goal of this project is to find ways to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities in a mock web application provided by the program. This project highlights the damage 
        that can be achieved by these types of attacks, and allowed me to practice the techniques that can help defend against them.
