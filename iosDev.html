    <h2>Book Catalog App</h2>
    After learning a bit about the Swift programming language and it's use in creating apps for iOS, I decided to create
    an app that serves as a a sort of shopping catalog for books. It would allow for a user to create a profile, and browse through
    the books available on the app. The user can see the summary of the books, the price of each one, can add books to a favorites list, 
    and view the included photos for each book. I used a a json file to contain the information about the books, as well as give each one a unique id
    that gets used in the Model Data and throughout the program. The app is interactive and allows the user to edit their information and their name, whether
    they would like to recieve notifications, and include a seasonal emoji (for fun).

    My source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/juiceleft88/Book-Catalog-App"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a>.

    <div>
        <p>
            In order to create a very organized layout, I separated out as many elements as possible into their own Swift file pages and subgroups:
            <br>
            <div class="container-fluid">
                <img src="Images/Book Catalog Codespace.png" class="img-thumbnail" width = "1200" height = "700" alt="Book Catalog Codespace">
            </div>
        </p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <p>
            Below is a demonstration of the app working:
            <br>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
                    <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="Recordings/Book Catalog Functionality.mov"></iframe>
                  </div>
            </div>
            
        </p>
