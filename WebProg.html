    <p>
        Before starting my computer science education, I had already created 2 websites (one for each of my businesses) through Wix. While not entirely the
        same as creating a website like this one from scratch, it still did help me in understanding page elements and positioning, as well as how hosting
        and domain names work. I will include those projects in the Misc page of my profile, and on this page will include only Web Programming I have done
        from blank canvas (without Wix or similar).

                I used the skills I have learned to create a webpage for my personal portfolio called chef2tech.me. Since I do not need to receive any form information or have dynamic elements,
                I have chosen to use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for this website initially. I am in the process of learning JavaScript, and will be looking to incorporate some of it's elements as
                my understanding of the language grows. In the process of creating this portfolio page, I have learned a lot about web hosting, domain names, and publishing a website from scratch. 
                Therefore, I feel its fitting to show the source files for this site as part of my web programming projects. I look to keep growing this site in the coming year.

        <center><h2><strong><u>Movie Review Page</u></strong></h2></center>
        <div>
            <p>
                The goal of this program was to create a web program that would serve as a movie review site. By using Java classes, Java servlets,
                jsp pages for views, and a MySql database accessed by a Java JDBC page, my program could create a session for each user (either existing or new),
                and allow that user to create unique reviews for movies that were either existing or added by the user, and store the information in a mysql database.
                <br>
                <div class="container-fluid"><center>
                    <img src="Images/MoviesLogin.png" class="img-thumbnail" width = "300" height = "300" alt="Minimax Scoring">
                </center>
                </div>
                I gave each movie info and review unique id's that could be attached to each user, then the review scores were aggregated among all users and shown as the new average score.
                User information was saved in a session, and authorization was also performed to decide if a user can perform certain actions (show/hide UI components based on user authorization).
                This security check was implemented in a controller page. It was quite a large project, and so I grouped all the component pages of the MVC in seperate folders so as to keep things 
                easily organized and viewable. The entire project
                can be found <a href = "https://github.com/juiceleft88/WebProgramming/tree/main/MovieReviews"><strong><u>here</u></strong>.</a>

            <p>
                This MCV architecture program uses Java classes for models, servlets for controllers, and jsp pages for viewers to create a dynamic webpage where Animals can be scheduled for Vet appointments.
                New Vet offices can be added, and Animal 'Patients' can be added to the different Vets offices. This is done by creating two classes, One for Vets and one for Animals, 
                where the Vet class can hold a list of Animal objects. Thus, each new instance of a Vet can hold a unique list of Animals. Servlets are used for the action pages, 
                and to set the id's used for each Vet instance.
