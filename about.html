    Hello, my name is Hugo Izquierdo! I am an aspiring Software Engineer, currently finishing my last semester of undergrad at Cal State Los Angeles University with a major in Computer Science. 
    Prior to my undergrad journey, I spent 8 years taking my lifelong dream of owning a pizzeria and making it a reality. I ran a physical restaurant and managed a catering business with a mobile 
    wood-fired oven for private parties and public events. 
    <br>
    While its safe to say that making pizza dough had taken a large slice of my life, it was all the proof I ever kneaded to know that having a strong work-ethic and willingness to rise to the 
    occasion would bring the ingredients to success into my hands. This led me into a new venture, the fun and complex world of tech. 
    
    <br>
    I consider myself a lifelong-learner, and genuinely enjoy exploring new and challenging topics about the world we live in. This leaks into my eagerness to bravely face software engineering 
    challenges with innovative solutions and a fresh perspective. Aside from my love for all things tech and pizza, I also like to enjoy downtime by exercising, watching the latest movies, cooking, and connecting with family.
