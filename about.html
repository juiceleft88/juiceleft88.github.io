  Hello! My name is Hugo and I enjoy oppportunities to learn new skills and create things with those skills. For the past seven years, my life has been
  centered around something I have loved since I was a kid: Pizza. I took my love of pizza and decided to start a business where I can share that love 
  with my community, while at the same time building something that I could be proud of. I soon found that having a passion for something does not create a 
  successful business on it's own. I started taking a more methodical approach, and learned how to effectively intertwine software platforms into my day-to-day  
  operations, allowing for more useful data that could be used in profit/loss analysis, as well as just making everything so much easier. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In 2019 I expanded the business into wood-fire pizza catering, which hit the groound running and had bookings for nearly every weekend of that year! This was a lot of
  fun for me, as it was an additional challenge on top of my physical location but also allowed for a lot of creativity in menu creation and experimenting. 
</p>

  Once I could really quantify it's usefulness for business owners like myself, my fascination with technology really took shape. While still operating my 
  business, I decided to start pursuing my degree in Computer Science in 2018. I was already familiar with tinkering with the company website, programming our point-of-sale systems,
  setting up and maintaining local and wide-area networks, and troubleshooting the various technical hiccups that pop up. So I figured studying Computer Science would be a 
  natural progression to what I had already learned. Fast-forward to today and I have learned so much about the field, and continue to push myself to keep learning and creating.
