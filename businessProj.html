        In this page, I will detail additional projects I have worked on and how they relate to the tech space.

            <p>
                My father and I started Blazing Stone Pizza from a concept in 2014. It was not a franchise, or previous business. The logo, recipes, menu, social media strategy, website, and business model
                were all started from scratch. We did not come from a restaurant background, but always had a passion for great pizza, and wanted to share that with our community. There were very many 
                moving parts in owning and running a restaurant, and managing all sorts of technnology and software is one key ingredient in leveraging sales. I learned to program Point-of-Sale systems, set up and maintain
                the local network for our service printers and POS systems (which was independent from our main network), how to maintain our website and add/remove elements to it, create and manage our social media platforms, 
                integrate and troubleshoot 3rd party vendor software, and employing payroll software, among others. This heavy use of technology is what got me interested in the field of computer science, and a big reason why I 
                decided to pursue this field as a career path.

                Aside from this use of technology, I also learned valuable things that couldn't be learned in a classroom, one of the most important being how to work with and manage a team to deliver a high quality product in high pressure situations with
                razor thin margins for error (in terms of profit loss and customer satisfaction), while still maintaining a cheerful, customer-service oriented staff and a fun, easy-going atmosphere.

            <p>
                Fahrenheit LA was my mobile wood-fired pizza catering company that I owned up until April of 2022. Using locally sourced ingredients, and an oven that could reach over 800 degrees, I would cook pizzas live at private events. I created and managed the company website using 
                Wix hosting, and also managed the social media campaigns, marketing, client correspondence/follow-up, profit and loss analysis, menu engineering, permitting, and of course driving the oven and running the actual events.

        <div>
            <p>
                This is my Cal State LA senior capstone project, and is a group effort between myself and 8 other students, in conjunction with the Army Research Lab. The goal of our project is to take outdated Human Perception Models provided by
                the ARL, and convert them into data that can be used by modern programs. Specifically, by using the model data for auditory and visual detection, we look to extract the necessary information into a Python script, 
                which we can then use in a virtual Unity-Engine sandbox to model the statistical detection zones for an SUAS (Small Unmanned Aircraft System) given a set of fixed parameters.

                Why is this project important?
                While the assetts of the US Military is incredibly sophisticated and far-reaching, those assetts usually require a cumbersome climb up the beauraucracy ladder to be utilized by soldiers on the field. Our research aims to assist small units of 
                soldiers on the battlefield have immediate access to reconnaissance equipment that can give as much real-time information as possible, while avoiding detection by enemy forces. This can help avoid harm to our troops, we well as avoid unnecessary collateral damage.
